# Sigma Spy Develop By depthso

If depthso ever reads this — hey man, hope you’re doing well. I’m not sure what’s been going on with you, but I just wanted to say that your code is absolutely amazing. Sigma Spy too — even though I only got to use it for like 4–5 days before it disappeared, I still think it was insanely good. I really liked it a lot.

Of course, I’m not claiming this code as mine — the repo name probably gives that away already lol. I just wanted to say that I genuinely enjoy your script, even if this Sigma Spy isn’t the latest version.

And lastly, if you ever want me to take this repo down, just let me know. I’ll remove it right away.
